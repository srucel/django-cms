Development of django CMS
#########################

django CMS is an open-source project, and relies on its community of users to keep getting better.

You don't need to be an expert developer to make a valuable contribution - all you need is a little
knowledge of the system, and a willingness to follow the contribution guidelines.

Remember that contributions to the documentation are highly prized, and key to the success of the
django CMS project.
